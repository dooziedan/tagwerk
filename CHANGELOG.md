## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Library scan: reads MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF and M4A tags into one common format, including RIFF INFO tags in WAV files without ID3. Runs in the background with a progress bar; unchanged files are skipped on rescans, deleted files are removed. Read-only.
- Dashboard: tracks, artists, albums, total size and playing time, formats, missing tags, files without any tags, and MusicBrainz fields holding non-MusicBrainz IDs (e.g. Discogs).
- SQLite database in `/config/tagwerk.db`, upgraded automatically on start (Alembic migrations).
- API: `POST /api/scan`, `GET /api/scan`, `GET /api/stats`.

### Changed
- The start page is now the dashboard. Setup problems (missing music folder, app data not writable, database error) are shown at the top instead of a checklist.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Project setup: FastAPI app, start page with a setup check for the music and app data folders.
